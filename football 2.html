    <h1>Why the football game did not get popular in india ?</h1>
    <p>The geography of India makes it difficult to play any sports which demands outdoor intense physical activity for a long time.

        When I first saw the Football world cup matches on Doordarshan first time in my childhood, I couldn't believe that players can run so fast while controlling the football. It was a surprise and it looked tough at first sight itself.
        
        It requires a lot of fitness and training from early childhood age to be the best in the Football. Naturally the infrastructure is not available for it and obviously it is not popular as much.
        
        However, with the advent of DTH dish, kids in the early 2000s started appreciating Football and started watching the leagues on TV but still their interest couldn't get a flight due to lack of infrastructure. Nowadays the kids in Metropolitan have a great inclination towards Football.
        
        More importantly sports in India is not seen as a respectable profession and academics dominates most of the time. A conservative and status sensitive society is big hurdle in promotion of any sports.
        
        People are not ready to understand and accept that the primary aim of a human being should be to stay happy and live peacefully. The sports is an endeavor, which is equally challenging, but with good training and dedication anyone can excel in it like academics.
        
        So definitely Football is not popular pan India but is very popular in few clusters of Kerala, North East India and West Bengal.
        
        It will be great to boost Football in Northeast India in particular and they can be the game changers for Indian Football.
        
        Current FIFA Ranking of India( Men) is 105.</p>
